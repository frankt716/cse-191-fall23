# Predicate Logic

While propositional logic allows us to express things like "if red is blue then Frank is color blind", its expressivity is rather limited.
For example, we can't express "all men are mortal" or "there is a prime number larger than googol" in propositional logic.
Predicate logic (a.k.a. *first-order logic*) provides a more expressive language that allows us to talk about these things.

## Predicates

Roughly, a predicate is a phrase like "x is prime", "x is larger than y", "x is the sum of y and z", etc.
These variables (x, y, and z) can be replaced with names of *individuals* to yield meaningful sentences.
For example, if we replace x, y, and z with 7, 8, and 9, respectively, then we have "7 is prime", "7 is larger than 8", "7 is the sum of 8 and 9".

then we have "apple is a fruit" and "apple is larger than orange".
