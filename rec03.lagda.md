# Predicate Logic

While propositional logic allows us to talk about things such as "if red is blue then Frank is color blind", its expressivity is rather limited.
For example, we cannot express "all men are mortal" or "there is a prime number larger than googol" in propositional logic.

Predicate logic (a.k.a. *first-order logic*) provides a more expressive language.

## Predicate

Roughly, a predicate is a phrase like "x is a fruit", "x is larger than y", where x and y are *variables*.
These variables can be replaced with names of *individuals* to yield meaningful sentences.
For example, if we replace x and y according to the following table

| x | apple  |
| y | orange |

then we have "apple is a fruit" and "apple is larger than orange".
