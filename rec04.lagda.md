# Predicate Logic

Recall that propositional logic consists of those logical symbols: T, F, ∧, ∨, ¬, ⇒.
This allows us to express things like "if it is raining, then the floor will be wet".
But propositional logic is not expressive enough to express things like "all men are mortal".
*Predicate logic*[^1] enables us to talk about these things.

## Predicate

A predicate is a phrase like "x is larger than y", where x and y are variables (placeholders) for some *individuals*.
Substituting individuals for these variables yeilds a proposition.
For example, if we substitute 3 for x and 7 for y, then we get "3 is larger than 7, while if we substitute 10 for x and -12 for y, then we get "10 is larger than -12".

## Syntax

The language of predicate logic consists of
- Terms: variables x, y, z, ... and constants such as 0, 1, 2, ...
- Predicate symbols: R, S, T, ...
- Logical symbols: T, F, ∧, ∨, ¬, ⇒, and two additional symbols ∃ (existential quantifier), and ∀ (universal quantifier).
